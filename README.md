# TetrOut

TetrOut - a hybrid of Breakout and Tetris. Shoot blocks and clear rows to move through space in your fancy spaceship.
This game was created for the annual game jam "Github GameOff" in 2018. Feel free to download and play the game!

Our team consists of four guys. We know each other from university and study computer science and work at Deutsche Telekom. We programmed this game in our spare time, because we were interested in game development and wanted to gain experience in working in a team and coding.
