# TetrOut

TetrOut - a hybrid of Breakout and Tetris. Shoot blocks and clear rows to move through space in your fancy spaceship.
This game was created for the annual game jam "Github GameOff" in 2018. Feel free to download and play the game!

## Motivation

Our team consists of four guys. We know each other from university and study computer science and work at Deutsche Telekom. We programmed this game in our spare time, because we were interested in game development and wanted to gain experience in working in a team and coding.

## Assets

Touch screen controls were created by [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/onscreen-controls). The artwork for the explosion effect was created by by Luis Zuno (@ansimuz).
All other assets were made by Max Schönleben ([@Zombiefleischer](https://github.com/Zombiefleischer)) and are licensed under the MIT License, feel free to use them but don't forget to give proper credit (...card, just kidding). A text file is located in the `assets/` directory.

## Audio

The background music is called "Paradox #2" by Dubmood (slowed down by 10%). Unfortunately I couldn't find any information about the sond's license, but this will be fixed as soon as possible!
