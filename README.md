# TetrOut

TetrOut - a hybrid of Breakout and Tetris. Shout blocks and clear rows to move through space in your fancy spaceship.
We wish a pleasant stay on this Github site. Feel free to download and run the game!

## Motivation

This game was made for the yearly game jam Github GameOff in 2018. Our team consists of four guys, who know each other because they study computer science and work at Deutsche Telekom. We programmed this game in our spare time, because we were interested in game development and wanted to gain knowledge in team working and coding.

## Assets

All visual assets were hand crafted by @Zombiefleischer except the touch controls. Those are from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/onscreen-controls).
